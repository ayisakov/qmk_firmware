Install avrdude, if not already installed.
Make sure you have a thin rod handy, such as an unbent paperclip, for resetting the keyboard.

From the root of the repository, issue the following to build the firmware:
$ make redox:<layout_name>

If everything looks good and a .hex file was created, connect the TRRS cable to both halves of the board, connect the USB cable to the left half, plug it into the computer, and issue:

$ sudo make redox:<layout_name>:avrdude-split-left

Follow the instructions on screen.

If this was successful, unplug the USB cable from the left half of the keyboard, and plug it into the right half. Then run the following:

$ sudo make redox:<layout_name>:avrdude-split-right

Follow the instructions on screen

Disconnect the USB cable, and reconnect it to the left half of the keyboard. Test the keyboard. That's it!
